<h1>MODERNIZED HAMLET PLAY</h1>
</div>
<div class="plot">
<h2>plot</h2>
<p>The play takes place in an insane asylum where Johnny(Hamlet) is a patient. Johnny belongs to a wealthy family and was admitted for his depression, anxiety, and anger issues after an incident with his girlfriend Maria (Ophelia). Johnny’s parents continue to send lots of money to the asylum so they have better funding to take care of Johnny. The head doctor(Claudius), is prescribing medicine to Johnny that is giving him Schizophrenic behavior because he wants his parents to continue sending money to the asylum. The doctor fires a nurse (the dead king) because she tries to stop what he is doing. Through flashbacks and dialogue between the guards and nurses we figure more and more about Johnny’s past and his current condition. The doctor hires a new nurse(Polonius) who is completely on board with the doctor’s plan. The plan starts to unravel however when the voices Johnny hears do to his schizophrenia start to make him suspect that the asylum is taking advantage of him. Johnny must now fight against not only the asylum staff but himself to try and free himself from this never-ending Hell he seems to have been placed in.
