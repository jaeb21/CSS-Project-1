            <p>When I envisioned the set the first thing that came to mind were the movie depictions of insane asylum. However, as I did research and thought more I wanted a setting that looked nice but was obviously old. The set I am envisioning is something that people wouldn't’t shy away from but you can still see the endless possibilities of horrible conditions. What I really would like to do it have everything on wheels so can have everything roll in for set changes
                For the hallway and background of Jonny’s room. I would like a wall that is double sided and on wheels so when set changes come you just roll it around to the other side.
                For chairs and beds the bed will be on wheels but the chairs will have to be picked up and moved.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lighting is going to be tricky.
        When in the insane asylum I want to lighting to be gloomy but not dark per say.
        I envision some blue-ish and rustic looking colors in addition to the main lights to still show the stage.
        However with flashbacks I want it to be darker with a more yellowish undertone to the lighting to show that this is a different time. 
        Also, when is came to flashbacks it wasn’t something I was as concerned about because I want the lighting to show the time difference.</p>
